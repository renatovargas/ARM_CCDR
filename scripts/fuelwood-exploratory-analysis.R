# 13.28 Do you use any of the following sources to heat the dwelling? (6 Wood).
# 13.29 Do you use any of the following energy carrier? (3 Wood).
# 13.31 IF HOUSEHOLD USED WOOD, ASK: 
#   A. How much firewood did your household consume  in  the last month?  (in m3)    
# B.How much did you pay for wood  in  the last month?
#   aa. How much firewood did your household consume average per year? (in m3)

#   by the household? (in m3)
